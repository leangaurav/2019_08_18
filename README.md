# Maintain Folder Structure:
- For each assignment, there will be a folder by name of assignment
  Ex: Assignment010, Assignment020....
- Create solution files by your name 
- Always submit by same name
- If names conflict add a number at end of your name
- Use Python Identifier naming convention for file names (use alphabets and underscores. Don't use spaces etc.)
  ex: gaurav_gupta.txt


# Before You Commit !!
- Before you commit always do a git pull.
- If a folder by assignment doesn't exist, create the folder and push.
- If folder exists add solution by your name.

# Commit format and Solution Format
- Create solution file by your name
- Upload assignments as plain text files in this format
